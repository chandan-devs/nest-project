## Description

Creating a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operation in NestJS involves setting up a simple API that allows you to manage a resource. Hereâ€™s a short description of how to create a CRUD operation using NestJS:

## Features Overview
- CRUD Operations

  - Create: Allows the addition of new resources.
  - Read: Retrieves existing resources.
  - Update: Modifies existing resources.
  - Delete: Removes existing resources.

- Authentication

  - User Registration: Allows users to create accounts.
  - Login: Authenticates users and issues tokens.
  - Password Management: Features like reset and change password.

- Authorization

  - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Restricts access based on user roles.
  - Permissions: Granular access control for specific actions or resources.
  - Guards and Interceptors: Ensures that only authorized users can access certain endpoints.

  - Error Handling: Provides a standardized way to handle errors and send appropriate responses.
  - Logging: Captures and logs application activities for monitoring and debugging.
  - Pagination and Sorting: Manages large sets of data by paginating and sorting results.
  - File Uploads: Handles the upload and storage of files.
  - Caching: Improves performance by caching frequently accessed data.
  - Rate Limiting: Protects the application from abuse by limiting the number of requests from a user.
  - Testing: Ensures code quality and functionality through unit and integration tests.
  - Documentation: Provides API documentation using tools like Swagger.
